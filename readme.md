####DefineInteresting
(Credit to those recognizing the series/movie reference there!) is your basic personal tooltip robot.
It's based on rTooltip by zork. I sadly couldn't mold that one to my taste, but loved his ideas. Without rewriting it all, I couldn't get it up to where I wanted it, so there "Define Interesting" was born.

####Changelog
- v0.1a : Completely drycoded to just annoy @Kaelten on Messages and Skype.
